<p> This whole project was about us finding classic works of literature and then translating a page out of the text into emoji's. Some of the translation process was difficult due to some of the word choices from that century but everything came together. I really enjoyed researching and creating this for yall</p>

        <p>Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson, or Robert Louis
          Stevenson, as he preferred to call himself, was the only
          son of Thomas Stevenson, a Scotch engineer, and Mar-
          garet Balfour, the daughter of a Scotch clergyman. He
          was born at Edinburgh, November 13, 1850, and almost
          from his birth he was a frail, sickly little boy, condemned
          to spend much of his time in bed.<p>
            <p>&#129321; &#129321; &#129695; &#127936; &#9917; &#127754; &#128367;&#65039;<p>
                <p>His mind, however, was as vivacious and active as
                  his body was weak, and there is no trace of morbidness
                  or gloom about him. Although he loved the open air
                  and all sorts of sports as well as any boy, he could turn his
                  counterpane into an ocean and see the most surprising
                  things in his bedroom candle.<p>

                    <p>&#129396; &#127988;&#917607;&#917602;&#917605;&#917614;&#917607;&#917631; &#127979;&#128104;&#127995; &#128161;<p>
                        <p>Naturally, Stevenson’s health made his schooling
                          somewhat irregular, but what he lacked in this way he
                          made up by numerous journeys with his parents through
                          England and the Continent. He was able, however,
                          to enter the University of Edinburgh, where his father
                          wished to prepare him for his own profession. Thomas
                          Stevenson, and his father before him, were in the Scotch
                          lighthouse service, and had built some of the most famous
                          lights in the world, and he wished Louis to carry on the
                          family tradition. <p>

                            <p>&#128102;&#127995; &#128218; &#128394;&#65039; &#127385; &#127979;<p>
                                <p>But young Stevenson’s tastes were all literary and he
                                  had determined within himself to become a writer.
                                  He had not, to be sure, showed more than ordinary
                                  cleverness with his pen hitherto, but contact with bril-
                                  liant and enthusiastic young men at the University had
                                  given him new incentive, and he embarked on the career
                                  of literature with a conscious purpose, and a patient
                                  seeking after perfection that must have succeeded even
                                  without the touch of genius.<p>
